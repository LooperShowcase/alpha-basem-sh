      In post-war Germany, parts were generally in short supply, so the 356
      automobile used components from the Volkswagen Beetle, including the
      engine case from its internal combustion engine, transmission, and several
      parts used in the suspension. The 356, however, had several evolutionary
      stages, A, B, and C, while in production, and most Volkswagen-sourced
      parts were replaced by Porsche-made parts. Beginning in 1954 the 356s
      engines started utilizing engine cases designed specifically for the 356.
      The sleek bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda, who also had designed
      the body of the Beetle. Porsche's signature designs have, from the
      beginning, featured air-cooled rear-engine configurations (like the
      Beetle), rare for other car manufacturers, but producing automobiles that
      are very well balanced. In 1964, after a fair amount of success in
      motor-racing with various models including the 550 Spyder, and with the
      356 needing a major re-design, the company launched the Porsche 911:
      another air-cooled, rear-engined sports car, this time with a six-cylinder
      "boxer" engine. The team to lay out the body shell design was led by Ferry
      Porsche's eldest son, Ferdinand Alexander Porsche (F. A.). The design
      phase for the 911 caused internal problems with Erwin Komenda, who led the
      body design department until then. F. A. Porsche complained Komenda made
      unauthorized changes to the design. Company leader Ferry Porsche took his
      son's drawings to neighbouring chassis manufacturer Reuter. Reuter's
      workshop was later acquired by Porsche (so-called Werk 2). Afterward,
      Reuter became a seat manufacturer, today known as Keiper-Recaro.
